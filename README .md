## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

- Centering the image between the background and the content and adding the border to it.

```css
.card{
  .
  .
  .
  box-shadow: 0px 10px 50px -5px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);
}
.image{
  margin: 25% 0;    /* This specifically*/
  border: 6px solid white;
  border-radius: 50%;
}
```

### Continued development

- I plan on learning more techniques to center items without using absolute positioning.
- Gain more knowledge and use examples for position relative and absolute

### Useful resources

- [CSS Generator](https://cssgenerator.org/box-shadow-css-generator.html) - This helped me in the making of the box-shadow for the card.
